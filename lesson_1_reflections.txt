How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

You could pinpoint where the changes were made

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You could easily go back to previous versions if you made mistakes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

pro's: you can make commits at logical points in your development.

cons: none

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

google docs is simpler and not for large programs. Git allows multiple files in one commit b/c changing multiple files can still be one logical change.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows commit history. git diff shows diff between 2 commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

you can always go back to the previous state

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
